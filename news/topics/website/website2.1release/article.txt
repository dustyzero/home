Hello everyone! There have been more changes to our website!
Welcome to 2.1!
Very close to the release of 2.0, I know.
Since there is now more than 1 article, we have added topic and article navigators so you can view older articles.
We have also added a dark mode, incase your retinas burned at the sight of 2.0!
Also, the weird shadow behind the hamburger menu button that would appear when opening the menu in the faq has been fixed.
We've also added the date on which an article was published to the bottom of the article.
