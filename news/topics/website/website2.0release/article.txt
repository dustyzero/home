Hello everyone! Recently, there have been some exciting news about dustyzero - such as the announcement of Bounce Boy - recently that I'm 
sure we're all excited about, but today its a bit different. Version 2.0 of the DustyZero website has been released! It introduces the very feature used
to view this article: news!
It also significantly improves the website visually!
It uses jQuery and bigSlide to create a hamburger menu, and that hamburger menu can navigate pages and displays the site version.
The site was actually supposed to be somewhat like this originally, but we made so many changes that it ended up looking like it did.
Even the news feature was always planned!
